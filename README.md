# TripleTen-Sprint-5-Project
🎮 TripleTen Sprint 5: Video Game Sales Forecasting
📝 Project Overview

This project is an integrated data analysis case study focused on identifying patterns that determine whether a video game succeeds commercially. The analysis is conducted from the perspective of December 2016, with the goal of helping the online game store Ice plan advertising campaigns for 2017.

Using historical sales data, platform trends, reviews, genres, and regional preferences, this project applies data preparation, exploratory analysis, and statistical hypothesis testing to support business decision-making.

📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains global video game sales data up to 2016, including:

Game title and release year

Platform (e.g., PlayStation, Xbox, PC)

Genre

Sales by region (NA, EU, JP, Other)

Critic and user reviews

ESRB ratings (e.g., Teen, Mature)

A new feature, total global sales, is calculated as the sum of all regional sales.

🎯 Objectives
